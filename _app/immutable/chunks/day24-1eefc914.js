<h3>Goal:</h3>
<p>Build a full whitelist dApp in Foundry - LW3 Sophomore track</p>
<h3><strong>Today's Progress</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Foundry: adds Whitelist contract</li>
<li>Foundry: learned how to write tests, how to test reverts, how to mock addresses, how to assert</li>
<li>Foundry: adds tests for Whitelist contract methods and properties.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Thoughts</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Should attempt to make an MR on Foundry on the issue I raised here https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4215. A contributor recommended it as a good issues, and offered some pointers.</li>
<li>Surprisingly straightforward to get up to speed with Foundry using the Foundry book https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/writing-tests</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Next up</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deployment of the contract</li>
</ul>
