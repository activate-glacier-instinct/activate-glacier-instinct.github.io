const t={},o=`<h2>Day 8</h2>
<p>Date: 14/01/23</p>
<p>================</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Goal: make a simple portfolio + blog site using SvelteKit for my anon account</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Today's Progress</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added blog post functionality to generate posts from a data file</li>
<li>Created a dummy data file</li>
<li>Added logic to load this data, pass the data to the component, or throw a 404</li>
<li>Added rendering logic to show this data</li>
<li>Researched how to query the Github API for files</li>
<li>Downloaded Insomnia to scaffold out those queries and include them in this repo</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Thoughts</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The blog post generation was wildly simple, but it was so because of all the available resources</li>
<li>Next step is to fetch my markdown files from my 100days-of-code and render them as blog posts</li>
<li>I will need to parse the files from .md before rendering and this is why I included the body key on blog posts</li>
<li>Will have to extend this sprint by 4 more days</li>
<li>Will start talking about and setting the allocated time in Fibbonacci sequence.</li>
</ul>
