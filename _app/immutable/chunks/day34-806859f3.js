<h3>Goal:</h3>
<p>Build a full NFT collection smart contract in Foundry - LW3 Sophomore track</p>
<h3><strong>Today's Progress</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Foundry: hit a roadblock with testing the mints</li>
<li>Foundry: removed the roadblock via mocks of the Whitelist</li>
<li>Foundry: figured out how to instantiate a contact, get its address, then pass that to another contract which uses said address for an interface, all within Foundry test suite.</li>
<li>Test Coverage at 36%</li>
<li>Watched: <a href="https://youtu.be/uWR78WyPSl4">Austin Griffith - shill session with 0xTranqui</a>; good video explaining a number of Foundry features and Solidity patterns</li>
