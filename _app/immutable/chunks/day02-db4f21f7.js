<h3>Goal:</h3>
<p>Make a simple portfolio + blog site using SvelteKit for my anon account</p>
<h3><strong>Today's Progress</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the build so that it renders on CI/CD deployments</li>
<li>Added a test pipeline job that run Playwright
<ul>
<li>Need to make the build and deploy job depend on the test job</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design
<ul>
<li>Made a mood board here https://www.figma.com/file/EACX3PwCLrEc2q3oHRtxU4/Portfolio---Moodboard?node-id=0%3A1</li>
<li>Wanted to design something quick and nice, but ran out of time</li>
<li>I've settled on the style and themes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Challenges</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Small issues took up a lot of time</li>
<li>Design research didn't feel like coding, but you can't code something without a plan and making a design is the best way to plan the UI</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Thoughts</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Really enjoying SvelteKit
<ul>
<li>Bundle is 99kb</li>
<li>Loved this interactive learning environment https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/prerender</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design seems to depend on drawing lines, physics, and animation
<ul>
<li>Need to research and pick some tech for this: P5, gsap etc</li>
<li>Design research helped me narrow down a font choice
<ul>
<li>I prefer simple and popular fonts, so I'll pick Roboto or Input (more developer oriented font, fits with the theme)
<ul>
<li>I may research a good all caps font, because it feels brave to have everything in all caps</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
