<h3>Goal:</h3>
<p>Build a full whitelist dApp in Foundry - LW3 Sophomore track</p>
<h3><strong>Today's Progress</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Setup Foundry on my machine</li>
<li>Attempted a simple foundry hello-world example, and encountered a lot of issues</li>
<li>Foundry: Raised a bug about <code>foundry init</code> circular dependencies - https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4214</li>
<li>Foundry: Raised a feature request to allow for project creation on systems that don't have git credentials configured globally - https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/4215</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Thoughts</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Foundry book is such a nice resource - https://book.getfoundry.sh/</li>
<li>Wow, Foundry!!! No started today because of the above issues.</li>
<li>Going to look at virtual environments tomorrow to overcome this and move forward</li>
<li>Not a good look when I can't even install the <code>hello-world</code> sample</li>
</ul>
