<h3>Goal:</h3>
<p>Build a full NFT collection smart contract in Foundry - LW3 Sophomore track</p>
<h3><strong>Today's Progress</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Created the NFT Collection scaffolding and repo</li>
<li>Installed Openzeppelin dependencies</li>
<li>Added the contracts</li>
<li>Went through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNMfMxGxeag">Intro to Foundry - video</a> from Patrick Collins to get a wider understanding of Foundry</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Thoughts</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Had some issues with the remappings. It was quite annoying since installing dependencies isn't really a niche behaviour.</li>
<li>Eventually fixed after reading the <a href="https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solmate-nft">Foundry Book</a></li>
<li>Wondering how I'm going to achieve the IWhitelist pattern here, as in how will I be sending the Whitelist address to the <code>IWhitelist</code> interface within Foundry? Maybe using bash scripting...</li>
