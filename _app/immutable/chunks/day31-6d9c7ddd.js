<h3>Goal:</h3>
<p>Build a full NFT collection smart contract in Foundry - LW3 Sophomore track</p>
<h3><strong>Today's Progress</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Foundry: learned about cheatcodes and how to integrate bash scripts into a project</li>
<li>Contract: started researching the contract tests</li>
<li>Contract: looking into interfaces and using Interfaces within Foundry tests</li>
<li>Contract: also looking into <code>string -&gt; address</code> mapping</li>
<li>Contract: also looking into ERC721 testing and ERC20 mocking</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Thoughts</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lots of learning, but no coding today!</li>
<li>Starting to think that I'm going to alter the original <code>CryptoDevs.sol</code> a significant amount, starting with the contractor. The fact that we're passing an address to the constructor is causing problems.</li>
</ul>
