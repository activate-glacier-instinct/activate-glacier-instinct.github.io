<h3>Goal:</h3>
<p>Flipside Crypto - Kevin Abosch Open Edition query</p>
<h3><strong>Today's Progress</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>FlipsideCrypto: signed up</li>
<li>FlipsideCrypto: learned about ETF and NFT data and how to product mint queries</li>
<li>FlipsideCrypto: created a dashboard about Open Edition by Kevin Abosch</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Thoughts</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Departure from the usual, although data analytics is part of my 100days-of-code plan</li>
<li>Flipside Crypto has been on my radar for a while, but the learning curve is steeper when compared to Dune Analytics</li>
<li>Useful video series: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymgtf44KgbI">Flipside Cryto - Blockchain SQL Training</a></li>
<li>Quite nice to get back into this, my last Dune Analytics dashboard was from late last year. I'm appreciating the in-depth learning content</li>
